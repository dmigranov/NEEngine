# NEEngine

A library for visualizing interactive and dynamic scenes in three-dimensional non-Euclidean spaces. Created using the Direct3D 11 API and the [DirectX Tool Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK).

Right now the library supports the visualization of the three-dimensional spherical, elliptic, toric, cylindric and hyperbolic spaces. You can also check out [the first version](https://github.com/dmigranov/SphEll3D) which is capable of visualizing scenes in three-dimensional spherical and elliptic spaces. 

The example project allows visualizing geometric properties of the universe according to **the closed FLRW (Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker) cosmological model**. You can also check out [the web application for visualizing these properties](https://github.com/dmigranov/friedmann-web).
